reminder:

list of top level functions designed to alter nca data in order of (possible) usage:
    
    out of dump loop:
        * ncaSetDownloadDistributionType (instead of always using it like legacy, offer it as an option)
        
        * ncaRemoveTitlekeyCrypto (can be used with digital titles + game updates in gamecards)
        
        * programInfoGenerateNcaPatch (Program)
            * calls npdmGenerateNcaPatch
                * calls pfsGenerateEntryPatch
                    * calls ncaGenerateHierarchicalSha256Patch
        
        * nacpGenerateNcaPatch (Control)
            * calls romfsGenerateFileEntryPatch
                * calls ncaGenerateHierarchicalSha256Patch / ncaGenerateHierarchicalIntegrityPatch
        
        * ncaEncryptHeader (doesn't modify anything per se, but it's used to generate new encrypted header data if needed)
    
    inside dump loop:
        * cnmtGenerateNcaPatch (Meta)
            * calls pfsGenerateEntryPatch
                * calls ncaGenerateHierarchicalSha256Patch
            * returns true if cnmt needs no patching
            * demands an immediate ncaEncryptHeader call
        
        * ncaIsHeaderDirty (doesn't modify anything per se, but it's used to check if any of the functions above has been used, basically - and by extension, if the functions below need to be used)
        
        * ncaWriteEncryptedHeaderDataToMemoryBuffer (write encrypted nca header data)
        
        * cnmtWriteNcaPatch (writes cnmt patch)
            * calls pfsWriteEntryPatchToMemoryBuffer
                * calls ncaWriteHierarchicalSha256PatchToMemoryBuffer
        
        * programInfoWriteNcaPatch (writes ndpm patch)
            * calls npdmWriteNcaPatch
                * calls pfsWriteEntryPatchToMemoryBuffer
                    * calls ncaWriteHierarchicalSha256PatchToMemoryBuffer
        
        * nacpWriteNcaPatch (writes nacp patch)
            * calls romfsWriteFileEntryPatchToMemoryBuffer
                * calls ncaWriteHierarchicalSha256PatchToMemoryBuffer / ncaWriteHierarchicalIntegrityPatchToMemoryBuffer
        
        * cnmtUpdateContentInfo (used to update content entry info in the raw cnmt copy after dumping each one - ignores the current content if its a meta nca)

minor steps to take into account:
    
    * check if rights_id_available == true and titlekey_retrieved == false (preload handling)
        * actually, just inform the user about it - this is being handled
